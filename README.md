## Features 👾
- **Multi-page Website:** The website consists of a series of html files linked together: the <em>main page</em>, where where you will be welcomed. The <em>contact</em> page with our data and a form if you want us to contact you and the <em>menu</em> where you can see the different beverages and food we offer.
- **Responsive Design:** The website adjusts to different screen sizes. I considered it better to hide the buttons in <em>menu</em> because they are not necessary in larger screens.
